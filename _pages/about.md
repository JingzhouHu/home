I'm a 5th-year Ph.D. student from the Department of Computer & Information Science & Engineering (<a href="https://www.cise.ufl.edu/">CISE</a>) at the University of Florida. I am very fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~kejun/">Prof. Kejun Huang</a>.
Before coming to UF, I finished my undergraduate at Nanjing University.
I have a broad interest in the general area of Machine Learning (more specified in an unsupervised fashion), Signal Processing, Optimization, and Statistics. See detailed topics include:


**Latent variable models' identifiability** guarantees us to discover patterns in an unsupervised fashion, including nonnegative matrix factorization, bounded/independent component analysis, dictionary learning, and tensor decomposition.

**Non-convex optimization** algorithms that are computationally efficient and (hopefully) with optimality guarantees.

**Applications** in various areas, including traditional machine learning, data analytics, natural language processing, and computer vision.
