I'm a 5th-year Ph.D. student from the Department of Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) at the University of Florida(https://www.cise.ufl.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by Dr. Kejun Huang(https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~kejun/). I have a broad interest in the general area of Machine Learning, Signal Processing, Optimization, and Statistics. See detailed topics include:

Before coming to UF, I finished my undergraduate at Nanjing University.
